# 🧡 Xverse TipJar - Midl VibeHack

**Native Bitcoin support for creators, powered by Midl.**

Bitcoin TipJar is a premium decentralized application that enables creators to receive tips natively on the Bitcoin network using Midl's programmable layer. It bridges the gap between Bitcoin's security and EVM-like programmability, providing a seamless user experience for the Bitcoin Token Economy.

---

## 🚀 Vision
The goal of Bitcoin TipJar is to demonstrate that Bitcoin can be more than a store of value. By leveraging Midl, we've built a "vibrant" tipping platform where users can send BTC tips with custom messages, and creators can manage their funds through a secure, on-chain dashboard—all while signing transactions with their favorite Bitcoin wallet (Xverse).

## ✨ Key Features
- **Native Bitcoin Payments**: Tips are sent and settled as native BTC transactions via Midl's abstraction layer.
- **Xverse Wallet Integration**: Seamlessly connect and sign transactions using the most popular Bitcoin wallet.
- **Programmable Logic**: Managed by a Solidity smart contract (`TipJar.sol`) for transparent tracking of total tips and tipper counts.
- **Premium UI/UX**: A responsive, dark-themed dashboard featuring glassmorphism, smooth animations, and real-time wallet stats.
- **Owner Dashboard**: Secure interface for creators to withdraw their aggregated tips back to their wallet.
- **Real-time Verification**: Direct links to the Midl Explorer for instant transaction proof.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Protocol**: [Midl](https://midl.xyz) (Bitcoin Programmable Layer)
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity (EVM-compatible execution on Bitcoin)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **SDK**: `@midl/react`, `@midl/core`, `@midl/connectors`
- **Wallet**: Xverse
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Premium Custom Design)
- **Utilities**: `viem` (for Bitcoin-to-EVM data handling), `Lucide-React` (icons)

## 🏗️ Architecture
The dApp uses Midl's EVM compatibility to treat Bitcoin as a programmable asset.
1. **User Interaction**: User enters a tip amount and message in the React frontend.
2. **SDK Logic**: `@midl/react` hooks facilitate the connection to Xverse.
3. **Signing**: Xverse signs a Bitcoin transaction/PSBT, which Midl interprets as a call to the `payTip` function in our Solidity contract.
4. **Settlement**: The BTC is moved within the Midl layer and recorded on the Bitcoin network.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- [Xverse Wallet](https://www.xverse.app/) extension installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Antigravity
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 📜 Smart Contract
The `TipJar.sol` contract is designed for gas efficiency and security:
- `payTip(string message)`: Updates the on-chain stats and accepts BTC.
- `withdraw()`: (Owner Only) Transfers the contract balance to the creator.
- `totalTips`: Public state variable tracking the total volume.

## 🏆 VibeHack Contest
Built with passion for the **Midl VibeHack**. This project highlights the potential of the Bitcoin Token Economy by making native BTC interaction as easy as modern Web3.
